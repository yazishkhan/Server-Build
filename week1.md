Hello, I am **Yazish khan** Writing this Documentation to share my DevOps journey With the Project of On-Premises-Server. Which I had building.




### 1. Introduction.
This is a week 1 of the series to build the On-Premises-Server from Zero to Hero.

#### Steps involving to build server: </br>
1. Choosing Hardware
2. Proper management
3. Installation of operating system
4. Error Debugging of Hardware and Configuration management    
5. Configuring the local network between nodes
6. Getting full info about SSH
7. Getting information about DevOps tools 

   e.g., Essential Linux Commands, Ansible, Docker, K8s, git, kafak,  
8. Installing the DevOps tools and configuring 

   (Note these steps may be random in the series of blogs.)

> ## 1.1. Choosing Hardware. </br>

#### This Server is of 4 nodes in which 1 is MASTER node and 3 is WORKER nodes
Remember **NODE** Build of single computer called as node We are building 4 nodes of server.

### I am using the Following Hardware </br>

| Component        | Specification            | Quantity |
|------------------|------------------------- |----------|
| **Motherboard**  | ZEB-H61NVME (1155 socket)| 4        |
| **Processor**    | Intel i5-2gen            | 4        |
| **RAM**          | 8GB DDR3                 | 4        |
| **SSD**          | ZEB-SD13 128GB SATA      | 4        |
| **Power Supply** | ITEX 450W                | 4        |
| **Cooling Fan**  | Intel Fan                | 4        |

> ### 1.2. Installation of Hardware.

- Step 1 :- Unpack the all Hardware properly and carefully.

### If you don't have knowledge about installation You must follow the User Manual or YouTube tutorial.

### âœ… Done! ðŸŽ¯

### Hear the all installation of Hardware is complete. âœ…

> ### 1.3. Points to be remembered.

ðŸš€ Follow These above steps for other 3 nodes.

ðŸ›‘ Make sure the installation of Hardware is Properly Done. No, any damage or miss 
installation.

âš¡ Manage the all 4 nodes in a Rig as per mine Setup  

> ## 2.1 Proper Management.

### A Setup of server I have Managed. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5d1596c-f26d-49c1-a178-f3ceb0631061)

### A. I have managed all 4 node in a rig 

### B. External component I have connected are :
- Power ON/OFF button
- Reset button
- Power indicator
- Drive indicator.

### C. This connector avilable in [Amazon.](https://www.amazon.in/DAHSHA-ATX-Power-Switch-Cable/dp/B078RHZRT5/ref=sr_1_14?crid=1A8O6YZIP055F&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cJcVQZtKG2ngr6N4o21_tdnytxCMWCIP3a12O5RlOZsDfR2cf1nTyAxEySh1EDBm4KD6gqnte6jiQtiZE59qRrfng7JNrcw6lWfgm4WjyfkWsdcjBr-B7RC2xzOBPdTb4NjC0qKCTHAyjnNv5ENGhhLjsPNugG50zRRHam9nU58KGIoOt6YQbgdkC6Wr92f-LjwhHTYZtjhK1sBnuui3u9b9db5zlB1uWKRue-dm8bY.ntQP4nl56HKDIWT2BPFFxVFiGN-mvk_kP2k6ilwjxYQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=pc%2Bpower%2Bswitch&qid=1742979578&sprefix=pc%2Bpower%2B%2Caps%2C310&sr=8-14&th=1)

### D. You can connect those connectors as per user-manual of motherboard.

> ### 2.2 Try to boot all node one-by-one.

1. Press Power on button.

2. If the Boot screen appears. Everything is done âœ… 

3. **Issues:** If Boot screen is not appearing check the all installed component.
- If indicator light is not blinking replace the power supply. Maximum chances of supply failure.
- Properly check the RAM. Unplug it and clean and then plug it.
- Check the processor is properly installed.
- If everything is properly installed and still node is not working there is a high chance of BIOS corrupted. Replace the motherboard.
- If it is booting and restarting multiple time replace the RAM. Possible the RAM is corrupted. 

### ðŸ›‘ Applying those all steps for Each Nodes.


## ðŸ¥³ Done
## ðŸ˜Š Hear We have Done the week one of building OWN On-Premises-Server
