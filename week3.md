## ðŸ’¡ Today we are understanding the ideology of `ssh` and password less `ssh` access using `ssh` keys 

#### What is SSH ?
SSH, or Secure Shell, constitutes a cryptographic network protocol designed to enable secure communication between two systems over networks that may not be secure. This protocol is widely employed for remote access to servers and the secure transmission of files between computers. In essence, SSH acts as a secure conduit, establishing a confidential channel for communication in scenarios where the network may pose security risks. This technology is instrumental for professionals seeking a reliable and secure method of managing servers and transferring sensitive data across computers in a controlled and protected manner. ssh runs at TCP/IP port 22. 
 
 - In simple meaning it is just a protocol/tool to connect the server by shell.
 - We can do any task on server by using shell access.
