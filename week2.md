   > #### Step 4 (Configuring Ubuntu and installing SSH.)
   1. First make sure the internet is connected via `WIFI` or `Ethernet`.
   2. Then just open Terminal and run this command to update and upgrade the OS.
        ````bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        ````
   3. Installing `SSH`
        ````bash
        sudo apt install openssh-server -y
        ````
        - It takes a while to install.
   4. Verifying `SSH` is running.

        ````bash
        sudo systemctl status ssh
        ````
        - It shows Active (running).
        - Means it working fine.
   5. IF it can't works it is generally of Firewall issue.

        - Check UFW status:
        ````bash
        sudo ufw status
        ````
        If UFW is inactive, you'll see a message like "Status: inactive".

        - Enable UFW (if inactive):
        ````bash
        sudo ufw enable
        ````
        - Allow SSH through the firewall:
        ````bash
        sudo ufw allow ssh
        ````
        - Verify UFW rules:
        ````bash
        sudo ufw status
        ````
        You should now see SSH listed as allowed. 
----
> #### Step 5 (Testing SSH.)
1. On the Ubuntu(node) terminal run this command to Know it's `IP`.
````bash
ifconfig
````
2. Take a personal laptop or computer of Windows/Linux.
    - Open its Shell/Terminal and type this command.
    ````bash
    ssh <username-of-node@IP-of-node>
    ````
    - `username` we set on the time of Ubuntu installation.
3. Then is show some massage if we are connecting for first time.
    - Just type `yes` and press Enter.
    - Then it ask for `password`.
    - Enter the `password` we set on the time of installation.
4. After it gives a Shell of node.

#### âœ… Now we can Access the terminal Window of Node.
#### ðŸ‘‰ Repeat These steps for Each nodes and configure them.
#### ðŸ§­ Next we can see the concept of SSH and ideology.
